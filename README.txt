What's done:
- 2x Not entirely shitty platforms
- 1 Controllable Player (WASD)
- Animations for that player
- A box that falls like a bitch

Todo:
- Pretty much all the things
- Second player (with different control mechanism and different looks)
- Moar objects to fall/be thrown
- A script to control how the objects are thrown (how many, what kind, what properties, where, how hard, when)
- A script to control <i>General</i> Game Flow (Flow of scenes and level(?) progression)
- Scoring?
- Player attacks?
- Start screen
- Game Over screen
- Music?
- Sounds?
- Background/Skybox?
- Talant and creativity
